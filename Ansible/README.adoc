= Getting started with Ansible
[source: http://docs.ansible.com/]

== Overview
Ansible is an IT automation tool. It can configure systems, deploy software, and orchestrate more advanced IT tasks such as continuous deployments or zero downtime rolling updates.

Ansibleâ€™s main goals are simplicity and ease-of-use. It manages machines over the SSH protocol.

== Installation

  [user@localhost ~]$ sudo yum install ansible

_Note: You may need to add epel repo or download the download the rpm from http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL[epel]_

== Exchange SSH key

If you need to generate the ssh key first:

  [user@localhost ~]$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
  [user@localhost ~]$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@hostname

Store the key to avoid retyping password:

  [user@localhost ~]$ ssh-agent bash
  [user@localhost ~]$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  
Test to see if you can ping the target machine:

  [user@localhost ~]$ ansible all -m ping
